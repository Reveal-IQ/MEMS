## Medical Equipment Managment System (MEMS)
Clinical engineering departments are faced with a challenge to maintain an inventory of life supporting, diagnostic and therapeutic medical devices. Data such as equipment model description, preventative maintenance (PM) frequency, PM procedure, and work history are prudent to prevent patient harm due to equipment failure. Thus, healthcare institutes employ enterprise IT solutions who adapt existing management software to the needs of Clinical engineering department. Such products require large budgets for implementation and maintenance.

Healthcare institutes within developing nations have limited access to enterprise solutions to tack and maintain their medical equipment and often resort to basic documentation which is handwritten or entered in a simple spreadsheet. Generating any metrics or reports from such data is time consuming and resource intensive.
The Medical Equipment Maintenance System (MEMS) is an open-source project that aims to develop a tool for Clinical engineers to inventory equipment, schedule PMs, record work history, and generate reports. Our group of volunteers, aims to design, and build this tool from the ground up using open-source tools and libraries
